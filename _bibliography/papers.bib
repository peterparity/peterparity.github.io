  abstract = {Identifying the governing equations of a nonlinear dynamical system is key to both understanding the physical features of the system and constructing an accurate model of the dynamics that generalizes well beyond the available data. We propose a machine learning framework for discovering these governing equations using only partial observations, combining an encoder for state reconstruction with a sparse symbolic model. Our tests show that this method can successfully reconstruct the full system state and identify the underlying dynamics for a variety of ODE and PDE systems.},

  abstract = {Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular paradigm for global optimization of expensive black-box functions, but there are many domains where the function is not completely black-box. The data may have some known structure, e.g. symmetries, and the data generation process can yield useful intermediate or auxiliary information in addition to the value of the optimization objective. However, surrogate models traditionally employed in BO, such as Gaussian Processes (GPs), scale poorly with dataset size and struggle to incorporate known structure or auxiliary information. Instead, we propose performing BO on complex, structured problems by using Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs), a class of scalable surrogate models that have the representation power and flexibility to handle structured data and exploit auxiliary information. We demonstrate BO on a number of realistic problems in physics and chemistry, including topology optimization of photonic crystal materials using convolutional neural networks, and chemical property optimization of molecules using graph neural networks. On these complex tasks, we show that BNNs often outperform GPs as surrogate models for BO in terms of both sampling efficiency and computational cost.},

  abstract  = {Experimental data are often affected by uncontrolled variables that make analysis and interpretation difficult. For spatiotemporal systems, this problem is further exacerbated by their intricate dynamics. Modern machine learning methods are particularly well suited for analyzing and modeling complex datasets, but to be effective in science, the result needs to be interpretable. We demonstrate an unsupervised learning technique for extracting interpretable physical parameters from noisy spatiotemporal data and for building a transferable model of the system. In particular, we implement a physics-informed architecture based on variational autoencoders that is designed for analyzing systems governed by partial differential equations. The architecture is trained end to end and extracts latent parameters that parametrize the dynamics of a learned predictive model for the system. To test our method, we train our model on simulated data from a variety of partial differential equations with varying dynamical parameters that act as uncontrolled variables. Numerical experiments show that our method can accurately identify relevant parameters and extract them from raw and even noisy spatiotemporal data (tested with roughly 10% added noise). These extracted parameters correlate well (linearly with <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><msup><mi>R</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>0.95</mn></math>) with the ground truth physical parameters used to generate the datasets. We then apply this method to nonlinear fiber propagation data, generated by an <i>ab initio</i> simulation, to demonstrate its capabilities on a more realistic dataset. Our method for discovering interpretable latent parameters in spatiotemporal systems will allow us to better analyze and understand real-world phenomena and datasets, which often have unknown and uncontrolled variables that alter the system dynamics and cause varying behaviors that are difficult to disentangle.},

  abstract = {Symbolic regression is a powerful technique to discover analytic equations that describe data, which can lead to explainable models and the ability to predict unseen data. In contrast, neural networks have achieved amazing levels of accuracy on image recognition and natural language processing tasks, but they are often seen as black-box models that are difficult to interpret and typically extrapolate poorly. In this article, we use a neural network-based architecture for symbolic regression called the equation learner (EQL) network and integrate it with other deep learning architectures such that the whole system can be trained end-to-end through backpropagation. To demonstrate the power of such systems, we study their performance on several substantially different tasks. First, we show that the neural network can perform symbolic regression and learn the form of several functions. Next, we present an MNIST arithmetic task where a convolutional network extracts the digits. Finally, we demonstrate the prediction of dynamical systems where an unknown parameter is extracted through an encoder. We find that the EQL-based architecture can extrapolate quite well outside of the training data set compared with a standard neural network-based architecture, paving the way for deep learning to be applied in scientific exploration and discovery.},

  abstract  = {We study the influence of the input spatial mode on the extraordinary optical transmission (EOT) effect. By placing a metal screen with a 1D array of subwavelength holes inside a terahertz (THz) parallel-plate waveguide (PPWG), we can directly compare the transmission spectra with different input waveguide modes. We observe that the transmitted spectrum depends strongly on the input mode. A conventional description of EOT based on the excitation of surface plasmons is not predictive in all cases. Instead, we utilize a formalism based on impedance matching, which accurately predicts the spectral resonances for both TEM and non-TEM input modes.}

  abstract  = {In a granular gas, inelastic collisions produce an instability in which the constituent particles cluster heterogeneously.

After two dense clusters of <span class="aps-inline-formula"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mo>≈</mo></math></span>100 particles collide, there are two distinct stages of evolution. First, the translational kinetic energy rapidly decreases by over 90% as a “jamming front” sweeps across each cluster. Subsequently, the kinetic energy decreases more slowly as the particles approach the container boundaries. In this regime, the measured velocity distributions are non-Gaussian with long tails. Finally, we compare our experiments to computer simulations of colliding, two-dimensional, granular clusters composed of circular, viscoelastic particles with friction.}
