<b>I am a physics Ph.D. student in [Marin Soljačić](https://www.rle.mit.edu/marin/)'s group at MIT.</b> I work at the intersection of <b>physics and machine learning</b>, and my research interests include <b>physics-informed machine learning</b>, <b>condensed matter physics</b>, <b>nonlinear dynamical systems</b>, and <b>photonics</b>. I am more broadly interested in developing new computational methods for simulating and understanding physical systems with an emphasis on incorporating <b>physics-based priors</b> and providing <b>interpretability</b>.

I received my A.B. in Physics and Mathematics from Harvard College in 2016 and am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Physics at MIT.
