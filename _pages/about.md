<b>I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the [University of Chicago Data Science Institute](https://datascience.uchicago.edu) working at the intersection of physics and machine learning. My research interests include physics-informed machine learning, condensed matter physics, and nonlinear dynamics, and I am more broadly interested in developing new computational methods for modeling and understanding physical systems with an emphasis on incorporating physics-informed priors and developing interpretable representation learning methods.</b>

<b>I received a Ph.D. in Physics from MIT in 2022, and an A.B. in Physics and Mathematics from Harvard in 2016.</b>
