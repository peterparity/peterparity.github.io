<b>I am a [Schmidt AI in Science Fellow](https://aiscience.uchicago.edu/) at the [University of Chicago](https://datascience.uchicago.edu) working at the intersection of physics and machine learning. My research interests include physics-informed machine learning and interpretable representation learning with applications in nonlinear dynamics, quantum physics, fluid dynamics, and other areas. I aim to develop new computational methods for modeling and understanding physical systems with an emphasis on incorporating physics-informed priors and identifying relevant and interpretable latent representations that lead to new scientific insights.</b>

<b>I received an A.B. in Physics and Mathematics from Harvard in 2016 and a Ph.D. in Physics from MIT in 2022, advised by [Marin Soljačić](https://www.rle.mit.edu/marin/).</b>
